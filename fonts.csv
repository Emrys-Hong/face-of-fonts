the links below  GOJO Industries  Inc  is the leading global producer and marketer of skin health and hygiene solutions for away from home settings  Our broad portfolio includes hand cleaning  handwashing  hand sanitizing and skin care formulas under the GOJO   PURELL and PROVON  brand names  GOJO formulas use the latest advances in the science of skin care  GOJO is known for state of the art dispensing technology  engineered with attention to design and functionality  Our complete programs promote healthy behaviors for hand hygiene  skin care and  in critical environments  compliance  In business since 1946  GOJO has a history of innovation in the field of skin care  Notable are the inventions of GOJO Original Formula waterless heavy duty hand cleaner and PURELL  America s  1 instant hand sanitizer  GOJO conducts scientific outcome studies with its products in real world settings  Our track record of leadership is supported with proven results  GOJO is a privately held company headquartered in Akron  Ohio  with facilities in North America  South America  Europe and Asia  The GOJO Story  Making Life Better The GOJO story began in 1946 with two people  founders Goldie and Jerry Lippman  and their ingenuity  inventiveness and compassion for others  Today  their solid foundation continues to evolve into new ways to make life better for people around the world through skin health and hygiene solutions   Everything I know  I learned from someone else     Jerry Lippman on the importance of lifelong learning The Spirit of Discovery Begins  Goldie Lippman worked at a rubber factory during World War II  After a hard day s work  it was nearly impossible for her and her co workers to remove the graphite  tar and carbon black from their hands  They used chemicals like benzene to remove the soils  but it was unsafe and irritated their skin  It was this workplace problem that set Jerry Lippman on a quest to find a safer  gentler solution  The Invention of GOJO   Jerry learned about a heavy duty hand cleaner that removed difficult soils  and started selling it to Goldie s co workers  They liked the hand cleaner  but not the fact that it required washing twice  once with the cleaner  then with soap and water  In search of a simpler solution  Jerry collaborated with Professor Clarence Cook from Kent State University  Together  they invented a hand cleaner that cut through the tough soils  safely removed them from hands and rinsed off easily  Jerry and Goldie first sought the name  GoGo  for their new innovation  In addition to being Goldie s nickname  they thought  Make dirt go with GoGo  would be a memorable slogan  However  because the name was already taken by another business  they settled on their second choice  GOJO  with the  G  and  J  standing for Goldie and Jerry  Early Dispenser Innovation  After the war  Jerry and Goldie turned their full attention to marketing GOJO Hand Cleaner  Jerry mixed and bottled it at night and sold it from the back of his car each day  Goldie managed purchasing and accounting for the growing business  With a natural instinct to listen to customers  Jerry soon learned that garage owners thought that his product was too expensive to buy for workers  Observing workers as they washed  he discovered that they were using much more hand cleaner than was needed  That insight led Jerry to develop the first portion control hand cleaner dispenser  for which GOJO was granted a patent in 1952  Establishing Distributor Relationships  GOJO products were used in gas stations across America and sold through auto parts stores  Solid distributor relationships were established through GOJO  Missionary Men   sellers who would load up their cars and travel for as long as it took to sell everything they had  visiting distributors and teaching them how to best demonstrate and sell GOJO Hand Cleaner  Over the next two decades  the GOJO brand came to dominate the heavy duty hand cleaner market  GOJO SANITARY SEALED  Technology  With a talent for marrying formulas and dispensing technology  GOJO introduced its first sanitary refill washroom soap systems in 1983  The systems used portion controlled  SANITARY SEALED refill cartridges  which were a more hygienic alternative to commonly used bar soaps and bulk soap dispensers  This new technology allowed GOJO to expand into the commercial hand cleaning business  GOJO earned a reputation for high quality washroom systems    pleasant  gentle soap formulas and the industry s most reliable dispensing systems  Expansion into New Markets and Countries GOJO began to focus attention on specialized markets like healthcare and foodservice  where handwashing and skin care could have a significant impact on health and well being  A complete line of products for healthcare was introduced under the PROVON  brand name  And grease cutting  antibacterial soaps were developed specifically for foodservice operations  Geographic expansion soon followed  and GOJO added facilities in Europe  Japan and Latin America  where a complete line of products were sold  The Invention of PURELL hand sanitizer An increasingly germ conscious world brought new challenges to GOJO customers  Restaurant operators started to face legal action when foodborne illness cases were traced to hand spread germs  At the same time  healthcare associated infections were identified as a significant risk in hospitals and long term care facilities  Concern grew over how to clean hands when soap and water were unavailable  Prompted by these risks  GOJO scientists revolutionalized hand hygiene by inventing a whole new approach to hand disinfection    and PURELL Instant Hand Sanitizer was born  The invention of PURELL Intant Hand Sanitizer was a turning point for GOJO and for hand hygiene  Realizing the potential to bring well being to people everywhere  GOJO launched PURELL hand sanitizer as a consumer product in the late 1990s  Hand hygiene was suddenly within reach wherever people happened to be  PURELL hand sanitizer soon became a household name    and America s  1 hand sanitizer  Evidence Based Outcome Studies While GOJO scientists realized the significant  positive correlation between hand hygiene and well being  they sought ways to help others understand  This led to the development of a number of scientific outcome studies  conducted in actual work settings  to prove the impact of good hand hygiene practices  Studies in healthcare indicated a reduction in the spread of infection  Studies in schools  offices and military settings showed reductions in absenteeism  Studies in oil refineries demonstrated improved skin condition  Scientific outcome studies provided solid evidence of results achieved  and became an integral part of GOJO market focused solutions  It became clear that hand sanitizers could play a significant role in health and well being  Experts like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the World Health Organization and others acknowledged the value of alcohol based hand sanitizing gels and included them in hand hygiene guidelines for healthcare  schools and other facilities  That  along with the success of PURELL in the consumer world  helped set a new standard  making both handwashing and hand sanitizing common practice in work and public settings  The Spirit of Discovery Continues  GOJO continues to evolve the science of skin care with new forms of technology  Formulations that improve skin condition with regular use Green certified hand cleaners New forms of product  like foam  gel and wipes Dispensing options that include touch free  counter mount and wall mount systems  freestanding hand hygiene stations and personal  wearable systems They are all part of an ever expanding portfolio of products and programs to meet the skin health and hygiene needs of a changing world  While science and technology have evolved  reach has expanded and geographic boundaries have become limitless  GOJO continues to apply the exploratory spirit and concern for well being that were the foundation of the company in 1946  We listen  learn and innovate to find new ways to make life better for people around the world    sector5

Gotham,Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who ve traveled  from far and wide  to brave the cold today  We all made this journey for a reason  It s humbling  but in my heart I know you didn t come here just for me  you came here because you believe in what this country can be  In the face of war  you believe there can be peace  In the face of despair  you believe there can be hope  In the face of a politics that s shut you out  that s told you to settle  that s divided us for too long  you believe we can be one people  reaching for what s possible  building that more perfect union  That s the journey we re on today  But let me tell you how I came to be here  As most of you know  I am not a native of this great state  I moved to Illinois over two decades ago  I was a young man then  just a year out of college  I knew no one in Chicago  was without money or family connections  But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for  13 000 a year  And I accepted the job  sight unseen  motivated then by a single  simple  powerful idea    that I might play a small part in building a better America  My work took me to some of Chicago s poorest neighborhoods  I joined with pastors and lay people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings  I saw that the problems people faced weren t simply local in nature    that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives  that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away  and that when a child turns to violence  there s a hole in his heart no government could ever fill  It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had  and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith  After three years of this work  I went to law school  because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need  I became a civil rights lawyer  and taught constitutional law  and after a time  I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate  It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator  It was here  in Springfield  where I saw all that is America converge    farmers and teachers  businessmen and laborers  all of them with a story to tell  all of them seeking a seat at the table  all of them clamoring to be heard  I made lasting friendships here    friends that I see in the audience today  It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable    that it s possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised  and that so long as we re willing to listen to each other  we can assume the best in people instead of the worst  That s why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken  That s why we were able to give health insurance to children in need  That s why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families  and that s why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never  ever be passed  It was here  in Springfield  where North  South  East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people    where I came to believe that through this decency  we can build a more hopeful America  And that is why  in the shadow of the Old State Capitol  where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together  where common hopes and common dreams still  I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States  I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness    a certain audacity    to this announcement  I know I haven t spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington  But I ve been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change  The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed  And we should take heart  because we ve changed this country before  In the face of tyranny  a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees  In the face of secession  we unified a nation and set the captives free  In the face of Depression  we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty  We welcomed immigrants to our shores  we opened railroads to the west  we landed a man on the moon  and we heard a King s call to let justice roll down like water  and righteousness like a mighty stream  Each and every time  a new generation has risen up and done what s needed to be done  Today we are called once more    and it is time for our generation to answer that call  For that is our unyielding faith    that in the face of impossible odds  people who love their country can change it  That s what Abraham Lincoln understood  He had his doubts  He had his defeats  He had his setbacks  But through his will and his words  he moved a nation and helped free a people  It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided  North and South  slave and free  It is because men and women of every race  from every walk of life  continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest  that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together  as one people    as Americans  All of us know what those challenges are today    a war with no end  a dependence on oil that threatens our future  schools where too many children aren t learning  and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can  We know the challenges  We ve heard them  We ve talked about them for years  What s stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans  What s stopped us is the failure of leadership  the smallness of our politics    the ease with which we re distracted by the petty and trivial  our chronic avoidance of tough decisions  our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems  For the last six years we ve been told that our mounting debts don t matter  we ve been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion  we ve been told that climate change is a hoax  and that tough talk and an ill conceived war can replace diplomacy  and strategy  and foresight  And when all else fails  when Katrina happens  or the death toll in Iraq mounts  we ve been told that our crises are somebody else s fault  We re distracted from our real failures  and told to blame the other party  or gay people  or immigrants  And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration  we know what s filled the void  The cynics  and the lobbyists  and the special interests who ve turned our government into a game only they can afford to play  They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills  they get the access while you get to write a letter  they think they own this government  but we re here today to take it back  The time for that politics is over  It s time to turn the page  We ve made some progress already  I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate  But Washington has a long way to go  And it won t be easy  That s why we ll have to set priorities  We ll have to make hard choices  And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need  more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go  Each of us  in our own lives  will have to accept responsibility    for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children  for adapting to a more competitive economy  for strengthening our communities  and sharing some measure of sacrifice  So let us begin  Let us begin this hard work together  Let us transform this nation  Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age  Let s set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed  Let s recruit a new army of teachers  and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability  Let s make college more affordable  and let s invest in scientific research  and let s lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America  And as our economy changes  let s be the generation that ensures our nation s workers are sharing in our prosperity  Let s protect the hard earned benefits their companies have promised  Let s make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement  And let s allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country s middle class again  Let s be the generation that ends poverty in America  Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job  and earn a living wage that can pay the bills  and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work  Let s do this  Let s be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis  We can control costs by focusing on prevention  by providing better treatment to the chronically ill  and using technology to cut the bureaucracy  Let s be the generation that says right here  right now  that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president s first term  Let s be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil  We can harness homegrown  alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel efficient cars  We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases  We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation  and job creation  and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world  Let s be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here  Most of all  let s be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we ve got  Politics doesn t have to divide us on this anymore    we can work together to keep our country safe  I ve worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world s deadliest  unguarded weapons  We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military  we can tighten the net around their finances  and we can improve our intelligence capabilities  But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe  But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq  Most of you know I opposed this war from the start  I thought it was a tragic mistake  Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones  the hearts that have been broken  and the young lives that could have been  America  it s time to start bringing our troops home  It s time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else s civil war  That s why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008  Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last  best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace  Finally  there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war    and that is the homecoming of the men and women   our veterans    who have sacrificed the most  Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love  Let us be the generation that begins this work  I know there are those who don t believe we can do all these things  I understand the skepticism  After all  every four years  candidates from both parties make similar promises  and I expect this year will be no different  All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten point plans and making grand speeches  all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country  But too many times  after the election is over  and the confetti is swept away  all those promises fade from memory  and the lobbyists and the special interests move in  and people turn away  disappointed as before  left to struggle on their own  That is why this campaign can t only be about me  It must be about us    it must be about what we can do together  This campaign must be the occasion  the vehicle  of your hopes  and your dreams  It will take your time  your energy  and your advice    to push us forward when we re doing right  and to let us know when we re not  This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship  restoring our sense of common purpose  and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change  By ourselves  this change will not happen  Divided  we are bound to fail  But the life of a tall  gangly  self made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible  He tells us that there is power in words  He tells us that there is power in conviction  That beneath all the differences of race and region  faith and station  we are one people  He tells us that there is power in hope  As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery  he was heard to say   Of strange  discordant  and even hostile elements  we gathered from the four winds  and formed and fought to battle through   That is our purpose here today  That s why I m in this race  Not just to hold an office  but to gather with you to transform a nation  I want to win that next battle    for justice and opportunity  I want to win that next battle    for better schools  and better jobs  and health care for all  I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union  and building a better America  And if you will join me in this improbable quest  if you feel destiny calling  and see as I see  a future of endless possibility stretching before us  if you sense  as I sense  that the time is now to shake off our slumber  and slough off our fear  and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations  then I m ready to take up the cause  and march with you  and work with you  Together  starting today  let us finish the work that needs to be done  and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth    sector5

Garamond,We Have a Mission Why does the church exist  According to Matthew s Gospel  the risen Christ made it clear   Go therefore and make disciples of all nations  baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit  and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you   28 19 20   Based on this  Great Commission   our United Methodist Church has stated its purpose   The mission of the Church is to make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world  Local churches provide the most significant arena through which disciple making occurs   From The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church 2008  p  87  Copyright   2008 by The United Methodist Publishing House  Used by permission   So the mission of our congregation is to make disciples  This is a four fold task  We could abbreviate our mission as one of welcoming worshiping nurturing sending   See The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church 2008  p  88  and Guidelines for Leading Your Congregation  2005 2008  We reach out to people and welcome them into the church We have a direct responsibility for people of the  world  around our church  the community in which we and others study  work  shop  play  and so forth  In this world are people with many hurts  doubts  and questions  There are some who are new in the community and feel a little lost  some who are proudly self sufficient  and others who are in desperate circumstances  Our mission is to reach out to them  listen to them  accept them  share the gospel in word and deed  invite them into the family of faith  and joyfully receive all who will respond  We relate people to God and help them deepen their relationship with God The second task in making disciples is to offer people opportunities for growing closer to God  Whether they are visitors or old time members  just beginning the journey of faith or well along the road all are in need of God s love in Christ  Through worship  prayer  study  and honest sharing  we help one another discover that the Holy Spirit is not far off but present with us  wanting an open and loving friendship with each of us not only friendship but commitment as well  Through our congregation s various ministries we encourage one another to give our selves to Christ  to ground our lives in the living God  We nurture people in Christian living Third  our congregation s mission is to nurture people of all ages in the Christian faith and to help them practice the disciplines of discipleship  The church exists not to serve itself but to serve the world  We come to church not only for our own personal enrichment but also to prepare ourselves to do the work of love and to get ready to be Christ s disciples in the community  Through worship  baptism  Communion  Bible study  prayer  and other means of grace  we re strengthened for ministry  We support people in their ministry As members of the congregation  we re sent into the community to serve those in need and to make our community more loving and just  We believe that the Holy Spirit empowers and guides us in these ministries and that wherever there s need and suffering  we meet Christ  already at work  But still  we cannot be effective in ministry on our own  So the congregation exists  in part  to surround and support each member in his or her ministry  We do not always succeed in our efforts to be faithful disciples in the world  But with the loving support of the community of faith  we can continue to grow  Excerpt from The United Methodist Member s Handbook by George Koehler  Discipleship Resources  Rev  2006   p  10 11  Used by permission  Methodists in Mission The United Methodist faith is deeply rooted in the Scripture and in the basic beliefs of all Christians  Out of that theology and the faith have grown some specific actions that mark United Methodists as Christians engaged in ministry to the world  The early members of the groups that eventually became The United Methodist Church took strong stands on issues such as slavery  smuggling  and humane treatment of prisoners  established institutions for higher learning  started hospitals and shelters for children and the elderly  founded Goodwill Industries in 1902  became actively involved in efforts for world peace  adopted a Social Creed and Social Principles to guide them as they relate to God s world and God s people  participated with other religious groups in ecumenical efforts to be in mission  Excerpt from What Every Teacher Needs to Know About The United Methodist Church  p 20 23  Discipleship Resources   2002  Used by permission  The Ministry of All Christians All Christians are called by God  through their baptism  to be in ministry in the world  Therefore  the term minister is appropriately used to describe any Christian who responds to God s call to reach out to the world and its people through loving acts of service  The ministers of the church are called to serve in a variety of ways   As Laity From its earliest days  Methodism has been a lay movement  The term laity comes fromlaos  which means of the people  The laity are the whole people of God  who serve as ministers witnessing to the work of God in individual lives and in the world   As Clergy Within the body of all Christian ministers  though  some are called to fulfill a specific ministry through the church   Deacons ordained ministers appointed to focus on servanthood  A deacon models the relationship between worship in the community of faith and service to God in the world  Deacons serve in a variety of ministry settings  both in the church and in the world   Elders ordained ministers appointed to lead congregations oc Christians in the celebration of the sacraments and to guide and care for the life of the community  Some elders may also serve in extension ministries beyond the local church  Local pastors licensed ministers appointed to perform the duties of a pastor in a specific church or charge  Excerpt from What Every Teacher Needs to Know About The United Methodist Church  p 38 39  Discipleship Resources   2002  Used by permission  We Are All Called to Minister Though our gifts vary widely  we re all called to and engaged in the one ministry of Jesus Christ  Some aspects of our ministry are easy and come naturally  Some are difficult  involving long hours  tough work  perhaps with conflict  perhaps with disappointing results  What drives us  What keeps us going  The list includes at least these three things  the memory of Jesus  life of service to others  which inspires us to follow him in ministry  the assurance of God s gracious love for us  which empowers us to love others  the promise of God s coming reign on earth  which draws us into action directed toward this vision  Let s be more specific  Where does ministry happen  It happens in our daily activity For those who are alert to the needs of others  each day abounds with opportunities to serve  We minister with our families as we inquire about one another s lives  as we listen and respond with care  as we touch  as we smile and offer a kind word  and as we decide questions and reconcile conflicts  We take time to listen to a friend in need and we respond  this is often the greatest gift we can offer  We minister at work  to both co workers and those we serve  We minister in the neighborhood or the shops as we go about the day s work  It happens through new initiatives We also go out of our way to minister  We hear of a need  read of a crisis  or see an opportunity to share God s love  It may be with someone across town  someone of another racial or economic group  a person with a disability  or a person of another nation or culture  We take time to call  to visit  to write  and to ask how we can help  We also take the time to respond  It happens through groups and institutions Many needs are best met by joining forces with others  We take part in community groups that are trying to serve human need or trying to change social forces that cause suffering  We give our time  our energy  and our money  Though others in these organizations may not think of it this way  for us it s Christ s ministry  It happens through the church Through our support and our contributions  we participate in the far flung ministries of The United Methodist Church in our district and annual conference  across the nation  and around the world  Here in our congregation we take part in service groups  we sign up for special action projects  we visit  we telephone  we lead  and we teach  And we minister face to face in all kinds of ways  both when we gather and in our informal contacts  Inspired by the example of Jesus and empowered by God s love for us  we all carry out our ministry  both individually and together with others    sector5
