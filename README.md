Typeface recommendation project using deep learning with dataset taken from corporate branding guides. Won the first Prize on the [Tsinghua's brain inspired competition](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/news-events/event/news/first-place-1st-annual-tsing-hua-brain-inspired-computing-competition/)

You will need  'GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz' or GloVe for the word embeddings. We did not include it in this repository
